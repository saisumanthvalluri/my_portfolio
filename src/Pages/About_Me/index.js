                        I'm a passionate, self-proclaimed Front-end who specializes in full stack development (React.js
                        & Node.js). I am very enthusiastic about bringing the technical and visual aspects of digital
                        products to life. User experience, pixel perfect design, and writing clear, readable, highly
                        performant code matters to me.

                        I began my journey as a web developer in 2022, and since then, I've continued to grow and evolve
                        as a developer, taking on new challenges and learning the latest technologies along the way.
                        Now, in my early thirties, 2 years after starting my web development journey, I'm building
                        cutting-edge web applications using modern technologies such as Next.js, ReactJs, TypeScript,
                        and much more.
